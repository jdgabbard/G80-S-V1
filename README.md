The G80-S Micro SBC.  The first computer I designed, and what led to many projects afterwards.  This computer has been the basis for many other computers that I have designed over the years.  And after quite a bit of consideration, I have decided to open source the design files for the world to use/abuse.

The source code for the firmware can be found here: https://github.com/jdgabbard/z80-G-DOS
